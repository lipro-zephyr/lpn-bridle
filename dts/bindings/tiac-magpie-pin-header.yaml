    GPIO pins exposed on TiaC MAGPIE headers.

    The TiaC Magpie layout provides five headers, each two rows with
    seven pins per row.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 12 pins for each header,
    left side pins are the odd pins numbered 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, the right
    side pins are the even pins numbered 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. The bottom pins
    on each side are used for ground, they are not mapped in the nexus.

             (GPIOx/1)  TMPHx/1  1 --o  o-- 2  TMPHx/2  (GPIOx/2)
             (GPIOx/3)  TMPHx/3  3 --o  o-- 4  TMPHx/4  (GPIOx/4)
             (GPIOx/5)  TMPHx/5  5 --o  o-- 6  TMPHx/6  (GPIOx/6)
             (GPIOx/7)  TMPHx/7  7 --o  o-- 8  TMPHx/8  (GPIOx/8)
             (GPIOx/9)  TMPHx/9  9 --o  o-- 10 TMPHx/10 (GPIOx/10)
            (GPIOx/12) TMPHx/11 11 --o  o-- 12 TMPHx/12 (GPIOx/12)
                 (GND)          13 --o  o-- 14          (GND)

    Board's silkscreen may vary depending your board, but coherent with the
    description above as it's according to the standard's specification.
    Not every TiaC board provides all five headers.
