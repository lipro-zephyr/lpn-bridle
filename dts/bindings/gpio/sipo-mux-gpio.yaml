      This property indicates the number of alway in-use slots of available
      slots for GPIOs in the underlying SIPO/MUX GP Controller instance
      by any GPIO previous declared nodes of this same class. The typical
      example is something like this: the first node has register 32 GPIOs
      with "ngpios = <32>;" and "offset = <0>;", the second node then have
      to register their 32 GPIOs with "ngpios = <32>;" and "offset = <32>;"
      and the third node with "ngpios = <32>;" and "offset = <64>;" and so on.
