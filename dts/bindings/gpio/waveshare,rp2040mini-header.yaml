    GPIO pins exposed on Waveshare RP2040 Mini headers.

    The RP2040 Mini layout provides a wraparound header on all freely
    accessible edges of the board and can be divided into three sections,
    two headers on the longer opposite sides and one header opposite the
    USB-C socket.

    Proceeding clockwise:
    * A 9-pin header. 9 pins on this header are exposed by this binding.
    * A 5-pin header. 5 pins on this header are exposed by this binding.
    * A 9-pin header. 6 pins on this header are exposed by this binding.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 20 pins where parent pins 17
    through 20 correspond to ADC0 through ADC3, and parent pins 0 through 19
    correspond as depicted below:
