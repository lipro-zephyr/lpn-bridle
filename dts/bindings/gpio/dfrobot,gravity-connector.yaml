    GPIO pins exposed on DFRobot Gravity connector.

    The Gravity layout provides either an 3-pin or 4-pin 2mm JST PH connector,
    along on one edge of the board. Information and pin assignment can be
    found at:

    - https://www.dfrobot.com/gravity
    - https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/dfrobot-gravity

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 2 pins where parent
    pins 0 through 1 correspond as depicted below (with cable color):

        4-pin      UART I2C

         (green) 1 TX   SDA
          (blue) 0 RX   SCL
         (black) - GND  GND
           (red) - VCC  VCC  (3V3 or 5V0)

        3-pin      analog or digital sensors

         (green) 0 A/D
           (red) - VCC  (3V3 or 5V0)
         (black) - GND

compatible: "dfrobot,gravity-connector"
