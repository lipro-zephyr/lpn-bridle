    GPIO pins exposed on Adafruit STEMMA connector.

    The STEMMA layout provides either an 3-pin or 4-pin 2mm JST PH connector,
    along on one edge of the board. Informations and pin assignment can be
    found at:

    - https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 2 pins where parent
    pins 0 through 1 correspond as depicted below (with cable color):

        4-pin      I2C only

         (green) 0 SCL
         (white) 1 SDA
           (red) - VCC  (3V3 or 5V0)
         (black) - GND

        3-pin      analog or digital sensors

         (green) 0 A/D
           (red) - VCC  (3V3 or 5V0)
         (black) - GND
