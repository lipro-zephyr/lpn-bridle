    GPIO pins exposed on Raspberry Pi Pico (R3) headers.

    The Pico layout provides two headers, one each along opposite edges
    of the board.

    Proceeding counter-clockwise:
    * A 20-pin header.  16 pins on this header are exposed by this binding.
    * A 20-pin header.  10 pins on this header are exposed by this binding.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 26 pins where parent pins 23
    through 25 correspond to ADC0 through ADC2, and parent pins 0 through 22
    correspond as depicted below:
