    GPIO pins exposed on Digilent Pmod header.

    The Pmod layout provides standard 100mil spaced, 25mil square,
    pin-header style 6-pin (Spec A/C) or 12-pin (Spec B/D) connectors
    with currently 7 pin assignments to support different use cases
    for GPIO (Type 1), SPI, (Type 2), UART (Type 3), H-Bridge (Type 4),
    Dual H-Bridge (Type 5), I2C (Type 6), I2S (Type 7).

    The peripheral module board will have a male connector. This will
    typically be a right-angle connector, at the board edge, for direct
    connection to a host board. The host board will typically have a
    12-pin right-angle female connector at the board edge for direct
    connection of peripheral module boards.

    The power pins of the interface (VCC) provide power from the host to
    the peripheral. The complete interface requires that the host provide
    the ability to switch the voltage on the power pins between 5V and
    3.3V. A reduced functionality subset of the specification allows the
    host to provide only 3.3V at the power supply pins, with no ability
    to switch. On the 12-pin version of the interface, both power supply
    pins switch together and always supply the same voltage. These pins
    may be shorted together at either the host end or the peripheral side.

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 8 pins where parent
    pins 0 through 7 correspond as depicted below depending on
    related "Spec" and "Type":
