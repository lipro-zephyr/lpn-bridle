    GPIO pins exposed on Adafruit STEMMA QT connector.

    The STEMMA QT layout provides an 4-pin 1mm JST SH connector, along on
    one edge of the board. Pin assignment can be found at:

    - https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma-qt

    This binding provides a nexus mapping for 2 pins where parent
    pins 0 through 1 correspond as depicted below (with cable color):

        4-pin      I2C only

        (yellow) 0 SCL
          (blue) 1 SDA
           (red) - VCC  (3V3 or 5V0)
         (black) - GND
