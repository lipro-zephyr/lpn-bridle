  Generic latched SIPO/MUX GP matrix controller, SPI binding

  Driver bindings for controlling a latched SIPO/MUX General
  Purpose (GP) matrix with a SPI master.

  The SPI driver should be usable as long as a Zephyr SPI API
  driver is available for your board. Hardware specific tuning
  is required using these properties:

    - spi-max-frequency

compatible: "sipo-mux-gp-spi"

include: [spi-device.yaml, sipo-mux-gp.yaml]
