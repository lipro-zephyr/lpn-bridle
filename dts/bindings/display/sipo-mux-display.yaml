include: display-controller.yaml

properties:
  offset:
    type: array
    default: [0, 0]
    description: |
      Optional offset for top and front pixel shifting. This property
      indicates the x offset for front pixel shifting as first element
      and the y offset for top pixel shifting as second element. More
      than two alements are not allowed.

      For example, setting "offset = <2 1>;" means in front of each row
      is a gap of two unused pixels and on top of each column is a gap
      of one unused pixel. In case of an underlying SIPO/MUX GP Controller
      with 16 x 32 usable bits the display width and height must be set
      consistent and appropriate to the offset to "width = <30>;" and
      "height = <15>;".

  inversion-on:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Display inversion mode. Every bit is inverted on writing to the
      display frame memory.
