# WARNINGS and NOTES for the disk name (CONFIG_MASS_STORAGE_DISK_NAME):
#
# 1. In principle, the disk name can be freely selected. If this is changed
#    here in Kconfig, then the corresponding property "disk-name" in the
#    corresponding Devicetree node with the compatibility "zephyr,flash-disk"
#    must also be adapted. This should be improved in the future, as it
#    represents double data storage.
#
# 2. If the FAT file system is used, the disk name defined here will also
#    be used as the mountpoint. The currently used FATFS implementation
#    automatically enters the disk name as mountpoint, which means that
#    an application can only reach the correct disk via the exact same
#    mountpoint name. Unfortunately, the current example application under
#    "zephyr/samples/subsys/usb/mass" is hard-coded at this point and only
#    expects the (disk) mountpoint name "NAND" and nothing else. This must
#    be changed, as this implicitly represents a special configuration at
#    source code level.

CONFIG_MASS_STORAGE_DISK_NAME="NAND"
