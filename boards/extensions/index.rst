Extensions
##########

Boards already supported by Zephyr or other Zephyr modules can be extended
by downstream users. In some situations, certain hardware description or
:ref:`choices <zephyr:devicetree-chosen-nodes>` can not be added in the
upstream Zephyr repository, but they can be in a downstream project, where
custom bindings or driver classes can also be created. For more details about
board extensions read the upstream Zephyr :ref:`zephyr:board_porting_guide`.
