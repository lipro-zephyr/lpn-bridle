|BRIDLE| 3.4.1 Release Notes (Working draft)
############################################

This project demonstrate the integration of |TIAC| support in open
source projects, like the Zephyr RTOS, with libraries and source code
for applications. It is not yet intended or supported by |TIAC| for
product development.

Highlights
**********

* |BRIDLE| as CMake package for freestanding projects.
* West manifest harmonized with upstream.

.. note:: See the changelog and readme files in the component repositories
   for a detailed description of changes.

Supported boards
****************

* Arduino/Genuino Zero
* Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21 (Seeeduino XIAO)
* Seeeduino Lotus Cortex-M0+
* TiaC Magpie STM32F777NIHx

Supported shields
*****************

* Seeed Studio Grove Interconnect Shields
* Grove Button Shields
* Grove LED Shields

Change log
**********

* |BRIDLE| can now properly find in freestanding CMake projects with
  :code:`find_package(Bridle â€¦)`. The CMake package configuration now
  falls back to Zephyr immediately and let it include again by Zephyr
  build configuration.
* All tests and samples use now this mechanic to find |BRIDLE|.
* The Seeed Studio Grove Interconnect Shields now supports the Seeeduino
  Lotus Cortex-M0+ board too, although the board already provides its own
  Grove connectors beside the Arduino header.

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

* PROJECT UPDATE to `Zephyr Project`_ v3.4

Build Infrastructure
====================

Take over the new build principles from Zephyr:

* Use West submanifest for upstream Zephyr and add multiple more projects:

  * HAL modules for: Renesas, Nuvoton, QuickLogic, Microchip, OpenISA,
    Telink, Texas Instruments, Infineon, SiLabs, GigaDevice
  * secure MCU boot module
  * Arm PSA tests module
  * TF-M tests module
  * TF-M module
  * TF-A module

Documentation
=============

1. Update all output messages in documentation to be in sync with the upcoming
   Bridle version v3.4.1, based on Zephyr v3.4 (samples and tests).
