#        instead of:
#        .*toctree glob pattern 'applications/\*/README' didn't match any documents
#        .*toctree glob pattern 'tests/\*/README' didn't match any documents
#        .*toctree glob pattern '\*\*index' didn't match any documents
.*toctree glob pattern %r didn't match any documents
