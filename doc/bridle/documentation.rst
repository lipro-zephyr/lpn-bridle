About this documentation
########################

The |BRIDLE| documentation is written using the reStructuredText markup
language (:file:`.rst` file extension) with Sphinx extensions and processed
using Sphinx. It contains all information that is specific to |BRIDLE| and
describes our libraries, samples, and applications. API documentation is
extracted from the source code and included with the library documentation.

The documentation follows specific conventions and templates proper to the
|BRIDLE|, which might differ from Zephyr's conventions and templates. Read
the `reStructuredText Primer`_, the `Sphinx Documentation` and the
`Li-Pro.Net Sphinx Primer`_ to learn how to write documentation.
