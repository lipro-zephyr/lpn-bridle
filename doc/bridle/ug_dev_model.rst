|BRIDLE| follows a development model that gives users access to both stable
releases and new features that are still under development.

|BRIDLE| is (not yet) an SDK that is openly developed and maintained by
|TIAC|. It is based both on code developed by |TIAC| engineers and on
open-source software projects, which in turn are developed collaboratively
by many contributors.

Users can continuously track the development progress of |BRIDLE| and even
contribute to it. This includes both the |TIAC| specific and the open-source
portions (not yet: of the SDK).

Any individual or company can choose to contribute to the |BRIDLE| codebase.
Contributions are welcome but entirely optional, as the licenses used by
|BRIDLE| allow for free modification of the source code without a requirement
to contribute the changes back.
