The |LPNB| follows a development model that gives users access to both stable
releases and new features that are still under development.

The |LPNB| is an SDK that is openly developed and maintained by Li-Pro.Net.
It is based both on code developed by Li-Pro.Net engineers and on open-source
software projects, which in turn are developed collaboratively by many
contributors.

Users can continuously track the development progress of the |LPNB| and even
contribute to it. This includes both the Li-Pro.Net specific and the open-source
portions of the SDK.

Any individual or company can choose to contribute to the |LPNB| codebase.
Contributions are welcome but entirely optional, as the licenses used by the
|LPNB| allow for free modification of the source code without a requirement
to contribute the changes back.
